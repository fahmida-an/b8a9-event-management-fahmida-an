These two facets, catering and decor, play a vital role in setting the ambiance, creating lasting impressions, and ensuring guest satisfaction. Catering, the art of providing delectable food and beverages, requires meticulous planning and execution. Event managers collaborate closely with catering companies or in-house teams to craft menus that cater to the event's theme, size, and dietary considerations.
